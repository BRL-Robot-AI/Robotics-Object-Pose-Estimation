# Contribution Guidelines

Thank you for your interest in contributing to Unity Robotics! To facilitate your 
contributions, we've outlined a brief set of guidelines to ensure that your extensions 
can be easily integrated.

## Communication

First, please read through our
[code of conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md),
as we expect all our contributors to follow it.

Second, before starting on a project that you intend to contribute to any of our
Unity Robotics packages or tutorials, we **strongly** recommend posting on the repository's
[Issues page](https://github.com/Unity-Technologies/Object-Pose-Estimation/issues) and
briefly outlining the changes you plan to make. This will enable us to provide
some context that may be helpful for you. This could range from advice and
feedback on how to optimally perform your changes or reasons for not doing it.

Lastly, if you're looking for input on what to contribute, feel free to reach
out to our team directly at [unity-robotics@unity3d.com](mailto:unity-robotics@unity3d.com) 
and/or browse the GitHub issues.

## Git Branches

The `main` branch corresponds to the most recent stable version of the project. The `dev` branch
contains changes that are staged to be merged into `main` as the team sees fit.

When contributing to the project, please make sure that your Pull Request (PR)
does the following:

- Is up-to-date with and targets the `dev` branch
- Contains a detailed description of the changes performed
- Has corresponding changes to documentation, unit tests and sample environments (if
  applicable)
- Contains a summary of the tests performed to validate your changes
- Links to issue numbers that the PR resolves (if any)

<!-- ## Continuous Integration (CI)

We run continuous integration on all PRs; all tests must be passing before the PR is merged. -->

### Code style

All Python code should follow the [PEP 8 style guidelines](https://pep8.org/).

All C# code should follow the [Microsoft C# Coding Conventions](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/programming-guide/inside-a-program/coding-conventions).

## Contribution agreement

**All contributions are subject to the [Unity Contribution Agreement (UCA)](https://unity3d.com/legal/licenses/Unity_Contribution_Agreement).**

By making a pull request, you are confirming agreement to the terms and conditions 
of the UCA, including that your Contributions are your original creation and that 
you have complete right and authority to make your Contributions.
